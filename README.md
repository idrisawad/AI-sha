### 2. Installation ### 

To use the Deep Learning Chatbot, you will need to install the following dependencies:

⦁	`nltk`: A library for natural language processing tasks such as tokenization and lemmatization.
⦁	`sklearn`: A library for machine learning tasks such as feature extraction and similarity measurement.
⦁	`transformers`: A library for state-of-the-art natural language processing models such as GPT-3.
⦁	`torch`: A library for deep learning tasks such as model fine-tuning and training.

You can install these dependencies by running the following command:

```pip install nltk sklearn transformers torch```
